# NYC AirBnB Price Optimization #
### By: Nate DiRenzo

## Statement of Need:

Optimizing the pricing of AirBnB listings makes sense for all parties involved. For hosts, having a competitive price point helps to maximize profit, without missing any opportunities. For guests, it makes sure they have options, and aren't overpaying for their stay. For AirBnB, it increases user engagement on both sides of transaction, and helps remove the barriers to entry for potential hosts by giving them one less thing to worry about.

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to identify the key features within the dataset that have some predictive power on price. Once we have identified and visualized those relationships, a further goal will be to train and evaluate a linear regression model that can predict a givien listing's price accurately.

## Success Metrics:
Our objective in this module is to deliver meaningful business impact to our proposed client, AirBnB. In that sense, the deliverable is a cost optimization model that, when put into production, increases both number of listings by 5% and number of bookings 10%, as well as reudcing the number of inactive listings by 20%, and listings with availability in the next 30 days by 40%. This would indicate that our model is removing barriers to entry for potential hosts, optimizing the market for existing listings, and providing a better experience to renters via more options at better price points.

For the model, our metric of success is accuracy with which it predicts the price of a given listing. In this respect, we would consider a model over 75% accuracy to be successful.

## Data Description:
We will use data taken from [InsideAirBnB.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) to conduct this analysis. We will use this dataset because it includes pertinent features for our purposes, such as borough, neighborhood, number of guests accomodated, bedrooms, bathrooms, and many more. A detailed dictionary of the dataset's features can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=982310896).
<br></br>
## Tools:
- **Tableau** for data ingestion, manipulation, visualization

<br></br>
## MVP Goal:
Produce an initial analysis of the dataset identifying and visualizing a set of core features and their relationships' with our target variable (listing price).
